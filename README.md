Data Cleaning Steps: I corrected inconsistency and missing values. For example, I used the IQR approach to address outliers in the 'Salary' column, ensuring that the analysis was robust. I standardised categorical variables to ensure uniformity and accuracy.

Manipulation Steps: Data modification involves adding additional features to improve analysis. For example, I created a 'Total Scores' column by aggregating scores from many disciplines, resulting in a single statistic for academic performance. This new component helps understand candidates' overall capability.

Univariate Analysis: In univariate analysis I plotted probability density functions(pdfs) of histograms, box plots and count plots on all the numerical columns. I also extracted outliers from the boxplots.

Bivariate Analysis: In bivariate analysis I presented the scatter plots, hex bins plots and pair plots based on relationships between numerical columns and I also identified the patterns between the categorical and numerical columns using swarm plots, box plots and bar plots. Lastly, I discovered the relationships between the categorical and categorical columns using the stacked bar plots.

Conclusion : The 'Salary' distribution is right-skewed, indicating a concentration of lower-level compensations. A positive association between 'Quant' and 'Logical' scores indicates reliable execution. Critical exceptions in numerical and categorical columns, particularly in 'Gender' and 'Specialization', necessitate further investigation due to their potential significance. 'Computer Science and Engineering' emerges as the most popular specialization, while the delivery of 'Degree' is true. Diffuse and hexbin graphs reveal interesting relationships, such as higher salary rates associated with 'Computer Science Engineering'. This inquiry provides profitable experiences, motivating further investigation to obtain the flow driving these observed patterns inside the dataset.
